# Practice 3: Provisioning and Commissioning with MQTT 🌐

This practice focuses on implementing provisioning (web configuration) and commissioning (DNS) based on the SDK examples `frdmrw612_wifi_httpsrv` and `frdmrw612_wifi_webconfig`, integrating the MQTT functionality developed in practice 2. This project demonstrates skills in network device configuration and MQTT-based communication.

## Objectives: 🎯

- Implement a provisioning process using a web interface to allow initial device configuration. 🌐
- Develop a commissioning process utilizing DNS for device setup. 🌍
- Integrate MQTT communication for data exchange between the FRDM-RW612 device and clients. 📡

## Functionality: ⚙️

The implementation includes the following key features:

- **Provisioning**: Use of the `frdmrw612_wifi_webconfig` server to provide a graphical interface for initial configuration settings.
- **Commissioning**: DNS-based commissioning to provide the server address and other network parameters.
- **MQTT Integration**: Utilization of the previously implemented MQTT library from practice 2 for communication between devices and the cloud.
